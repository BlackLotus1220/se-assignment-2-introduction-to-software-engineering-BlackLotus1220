# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools so as develop and maintain* high quality software systems.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
There ar a numer of ways software engineering differs from traditonal programming, such as;
i) Software engineering involves the systematic design, development, operation and maintenance of software systems while traditional programming typically involves writing code in order to solve a specfic problem without considering long term scalabilty of the code.
ii) While traditional programming is more focused on writing code without considering the overall strucuture and architecture of the software, software engineeing involves planning, requirement analysis, design, testing and maintenance of software systems.
iii) While traditional programming is more isolated and focused on individual projects, software engineering emphasizes collaboration and teamwork.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Sofware Development Life Cycle(SDLC) refers to the systematic process of building and deploying software.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

i) Requirements- This step involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
ii) Design- This phase involves creating highlevel and detail designs of the sftware architecture and user interface.
iii) Implementation- Writing code and the building software accprdong to dsignspecifications.
iv) Testing- This involves conducting varius tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
v) Deploymnet- This involves releasing the developed software to users or customers.
vi) Maintenance- This includes providing continuous support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
i)Waterfall model follows a more  and rigid  approach in that the development process is divided into phases that are completed one after the other.
 This type of model is preferred for well designed projects whereby the requirements are clearly understood and highly unlikely to change during the design process.
 ii)Agile model breaks the developmetn process into small iterations hence allowing flexibility and adaptability during the process.
 This model is more likely to be preferred where the requiremnets are likely to change or evolve.


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
i)Requirements engineering is the process of dfining, documenting, and maintaining requirements for a softare system.
Requirements engineering helps to provide a clear pat for the debvelopment team, guiding decisions on design, implementation and testing.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is the process of breaking down a software system into small intercoonnected modules that can be tested and maintained independently.
Modularity overall creates flexible, robust and adaptable systems that are easier to manage, extend and evolve over time.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
i) Unit testing- This involves testing individual units or components.
ii) Intergration testing- This step involves testing interactions between different units of the software to identify if there are any issues that may arise when said components are combined.
iii) System testing- Involves testing the whol software as a whole to confirm if it meets specified requirements.
iv)Acceptance testing- This step involves testing before the software is released to ensure it meets user requirements and ensure it meets their needs and expectations. 

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version conrol systems are software tools that assist developers to manage changes to the source code and other files. Some popular version control systems iclude Git and subversion.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
Challenges:
i)Time management- Managing timelines and deadlines and aslo dealing with unexpected delays can be challenging.
ii)Risk management- Dealing with uncertainites and unforeseen events is tough since it requires the skill to identify, assess and mitigate said risks.
iii) Resource allocation- Ensuring that a project has the necessary human, technoogical and other resources is challenging.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintennce is the process of modifying and updating software after being released to cutomers.
Software maintenance ensures that the software remains functional and continues o mee the needs of customers over time.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Some ethical issues software engineers face include;
i) Privacy of personal data used within their applications.
ii) Security of collected user data from breches.
iii) Intellectual property
